Peeking Inside the Black-Box: A Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),IEEE Access,"Amina Adadi, M. Berrada","At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, we are witnessing a fast and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily life, which contributes to accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society. However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.",Policy Development,2018.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8466590

AI Based Information Systems,SciSpace,"Peter Buxmann, Thomas Hess, Jason Bennett Thatcher","Artificial intelligence (AI) is about to bring fundamental changes in our society and economy, touching on how organizations make decisions, deliver services, and evaluate opportunities. Given the breadth of their potential reach across companies of different sizes and in different industries, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee of MIT even speak of AI as ‘‘the most important general-purpose technology of our era’’ (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2017, p. 2). Today, AI applications in most of the cases are based upon machine learning algorithms, whereby supervised learning, in particular, has become established in practice. Consistent with this optimistic view, leaders in practice predict the widespread use of AI technologies. Forbes, for example, conducted a study among more than 300 executives. 95 percent of the Forbes study’s participants believe that AI will play an essential role in their companies in the future (Forbes Insights Team 2018). The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) study predicts that AI’s application in companies will result in a global value-added contribution of USD 13 trillion by 2030 (Bughin et al. 2018). AI is already being woven into common applications (Buxmann and Schmidt 2021). For example, AI applications that use machine learning algorithms are used to enable essential firm activities, such as analysis of financial credits, to determine the status of production machines, to support essential services, such as law enforcement, and to protect personal data through cybersecurity. Moreover, AI’s application in health care research – e.g., identifying possible treatment plans or use in drug discovery – have assumed even greater importance as scientists search for treatment and vaccinations in COVID-19-times. From an economic perspective, AI holds the potential to help people, businesses, and governments to lower costs of service delivery and speed up the time required to make decisions. In many cases, algorithms also make faster, more systematic, evidence-based decisions than humans. On the other hand, costs and speed are not the only considerations relevant to decisions. There is a need for a broader conversation about the ethical aspects of decisionmaking and using AI to make decisions that affect people’s lives. These concerns about the potential risks posed to fairness, non-discrimination, transparency and privacy merit attention from policymakers, business leaders, and academic scientists. Of course, no one can tell for sure whether these optimistic and pessimistic forecasts will come true. However, such forecasts command attention, suggesting that rather than a passing fashion, AI will be woven into organizations and society in the years to come.

Artificial Intelligence adoption and system-wide change,Journal of economics and management strategy,"Joshua S. Gans, Avi Goldfarb","Analyses of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption focus on its adoption at the individual task level. What has received significantly less attention is how AI adoption is shaped by the fact that organizations are composed of many interacting tasks. AI adoption may, therefore, require system-wide change, which is both a constraint and an opportunity. We provide the first formal analysis where multiple tasks may be part of an interdependent system. We find that reliance on AI, a prediction tool, increases decision variation, which, in turn, raises challenges if decisions across the organization interact. Reducing inter-dependencies between decisions softens that impact and can facilitate AI adoption. However, it does this at the expense of synergies. By contrast, when there are mechanisms for inter-decision coordination, AI adoption is enhanced when there are more inter-dependencies. Consequently, we show that there are important cases where AI adoption will be enhanced when it can be adopted beyond tasks but as part of a designed organizational system.",Strategic Decision Making,2023,https://typeset.io/papers/artificial-intelligence-adoption-and-system-wide-change-t4mr893e

","In this scoping essay, we discuss the potential for generative artificial intelligence (GAI) to shape the work of organizational change, development, or strategy implementation professionals. Using a case example of a culture change initiative, we illustrate how practitioners can benefit from using GAI tools to augment relevant change activities in planning initiative content and roll-out, mobilizing stakeholders, and monitoring initiative progress. We conclude with a reflection on the limitations of GAI systems and outline directions for future research related to (1) stakeholder responses to GAI, (2) GAI impact on the nature of change work, and (3) GAI value creation for change work and unintended consequences of GAI use.",Strategic Decision Making,2023,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00218863231168974
