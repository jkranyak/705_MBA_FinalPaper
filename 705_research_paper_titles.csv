Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),International Journal of Food and Nutritional Science,"Ranu Sewada, Ashwani Jangid, Piyush Kumar, Neha Mishra","Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a critical facet in the realm of machine learning and artificial intelligence, responding to the increasing complexity of models, particularly deep neural networks, and the subsequent need for transparent decision making processes. This research paper delves into the essence of XAI, unraveling its significance across diverse domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. As a countermeasure to the opacity of intricate models, the paper explores various XAI methods and techniques, including LIME and SHAP, weighing their interpretability against computational efficiency and accuracy. Through an examination of real-world applications, the research elucidates how XAI not only enhances decision-making processes but also influences user trust and acceptance in AI systems. However, the paper also scrutinizes the delicate balance between interpretability and performance, shedding light on instances where the pursuit of accuracy may compromise explain-ability. Additionally, it navigates through the current challenges and limitations in XAI, the regulatory landscape surrounding AI explain-ability, and offers insights into future trends and directions, fostering a comprehensive understanding of XAI's present state and future potential.",2023.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e1d2f2a717aa03280126f87c8e5fad695f52bf7c

Peeking Inside the Black-Box: A Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),IEEE Access,"Amina Adadi, M. Berrada","At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, we are witnessing a fast and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily life, which contributes to accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society. However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.",2018.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21dff47a4142445f83016da0819ffe6dd2947f66

Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4,arXiv.org,"Sébastien Bubeck, Varun Chandrasekaran, Ronen Eldan, J. Gehrke, Eric Horvitz, Ece Kamar, Peter Lee, Y. Lee, Yuan-Fang Li, Scott M. Lundberg, Harsha Nori, Hamid Palangi, Marco Tulio Ribeiro, Yi Zhang","Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.",2023.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/574beee702be3856d60aa482ec725168fe64fc99
